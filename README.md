# What type of caster are you?

A very basic quiz to tell you what type of magic suits you.

## Description

A quiz that I first created when learning HTML and CSS from CodeCombat. As I learnt more about web design from the Odin Project course, I decided to see if I could recreate it. Created in my beginner programming days!
